The fitting parameters for the polynomial fit are [  0.57465867   4.72586144 -11.12821778   7.66867762]
The fitting parameters for modified chebyshev are [1.16096948 0.39351447 0.04684983 0.23964618]
The condition number for matrices for polynomial regression and modified chebyshev are 12104.9487 and 3.8561 respectively
The lower conditional number of modified basis method tells us about the numerical stability and accuracy
